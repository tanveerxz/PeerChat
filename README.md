# PeerChat

PeerChat is a peer to peer networking solution that uses,
Quantum-Proof NTRU Algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRUEncrypt) to encrypt the data.
It uses End to End encryption to ensure that the data is not tampered with.

It is a simple chating application that allows peers to chat with each other in a secure way.


It is made completely in python and uses Kivy for GUI and has only been tested on
Windows 10 and Windows 11 with pyhton 3.10.
